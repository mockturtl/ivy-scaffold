# ivy-scaffold

This project provides a scaffold to add third-party libraries to an ivy repository on the local filesystem.

## requirements

You need a JDK with Ivy installed.  I'm using OpenJDK 7 and Ivy 2.2.0.

## usage

Run `publish` to deploy artifacts in the `target` directory.

See `ivy.xml` and `.ivysettings` for details.
